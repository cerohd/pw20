          Earlier this week the NYC MTA released a new digital-first map. The Curbed
    exclusive that announced its release accurately portrays it as a strange child
    of both the 1972 map design by Massimo Vignelli and the current “paper” map. One
    feature of the new map (though it&#x27;s harder than it should be to notice at first)

          I just finished my first week as part of the Fall 1 &#x27;20 batch at Recurse Center.
    I tried to split my time between being social and building skills that I want to
    use for future projects. The social aspect of RC is interesting because this
    batch is being conducted remotely.

    each cycle. I compiled a long list of potential APIs to use, but didn’t get past
