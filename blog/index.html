          Like most of the world, I’ve been spending a lot of time at home lately. Over
    the winter I was experimenting with building my own web-based digital tools,
    like an app to track articles and books I was reading. I initially thought I
    would need to buy hosting space to have the app accessible, but realized I
    mostly needed to use it when I was at home… <a href="/blog/how-to-raspberry-pi-server/" aria-label="Read more about How to Set Up a Raspberry Pi as a Home Webserver"> Read More&nbsp;→</a>

    of both the 1972 map design by Massimo Vignelli and the current “paper” map. One
