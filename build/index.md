Hello, I’m Patrick Weaver, this is my website. I’m an artist, programmer, writer, musician, and generally creative person based in San Francisco.

I grew up in San Francisco, have a degree in Literature and Language Studies from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and lived in NYC on and off from 2009 to 2022 before moving back to SF.
