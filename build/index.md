## About

<div class="blob">
  
  Hi, I'm Patrick Weaver, an artist, educator, writer, programmer, musician, and designer based in New York City, and sometimes other places. I'm currently interested in working on projects that explore new ways we can interact with each other using experimental or unconventional interfaces.

  You can reach me via email at [hello.patrickw@gmail.com](mailto:hello.patrickw@gmail.com) or on Twitter at [@patrickweave_r](https://twitter.com/patrickweave_r).

  Here is a drawing of 100 eyes:
