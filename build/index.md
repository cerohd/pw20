Hello, I’m Patrick Weaver, this is my website. I’m an artist, programmer, writer, musician, and generally creative person based for the most part in New York City.

I grew up in San Francisco, have a degree in Literature and Language Studies from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and have lived in NYC on and off since 2009.

You can reach me via email at [hello.patrickw@gmail.com](mailto:hello.patrickw@gmail.com) or on Twitter at [@patrickweave_r](https://twitter.com/patrickweave_r).

Here is a drawing of some shapes:
