#### 11/12/20: Remixable Jeopardy App with Historical Games

I found [a Jeopardy app](https://jeopardy.glitch.me/) on Glitch, and [remixed it to make the CSS look closer to the real board](https://jeopardy-remixable-app.glitch.me/). When I shared it on Twitter someone sent me an API they had made with all of the historical Jeopardy games, so I added a way to query their API and now you can play any game live in the app!

Here's a game from Jan 3, 2000: [jeopardy-remixable-app.glitch.me/#date=2000-01-03R1](https://jeopardy-remixable-app.glitch.me/#date=2000-01-03R1)
