In the Fall of 2020 I [participated in a 12 week batch](https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog/a-recurse-center-remote-batch/) at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com). A few months earlier RC had transitioned to hosting Recursers remotely because of the pandemic, which is how they continue to operate now in Summer 2022. While I had a lot of experience working remotely, both before and during the pandemic, RC was the first time where I was working with people in more than 1 or 2 other timezones.
