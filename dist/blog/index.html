Earlier this year I wanted to explore the new async/await functionality in
Javascript so I started playing around with a project on Glitch (glitch.com)
that would call one API after another, then generate new API call options from
each cycle. I compiled a long list of potential APIs to use, but didn’t get past
chaining together an API that will … <a href="dist/blog/building-a-futuristic-record-player-with-glitch-and-raspberry-pi/index.html">Read More →</a>

      This fall Mouse (mouse.org) launched our brand new Sewable Tech Course! The
course introduces learners to circuitry and electronics without the abstraction
of a breadboard. In the final two projects in the course we use a wearable
Arduino to prototype a DIY activity tracker.

      When Mouse moved into our new office in early 2015, we were excited to have
space for our high school Design League program to spread out and work on
assistive technology projects like 1derphone, a motorized headphone for a DJ
with limited mobility. We also quickly realized we had the chance to reach more
students in more ways by hosting flexible … <a href="dist/blog/how-we-used-a-chatbot-to-teach-writing-and-coding/index.html">Read More →</a>
