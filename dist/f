    <title>How we used a chatbot to teach writing and coding!</title>
    <link href="http://example.com/blog/how-we-used-a-chatbot-to-teach-writing-and-coding/"/>
    <updated>2016-06-15T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
    <id>http://example.com/blog/how-we-used-a-chatbot-to-teach-writing-and-coding/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://mouse.org/&quot;&gt;Mouse&lt;/a&gt; moved into our new office in early 2015, we were excited to have space for our high school &lt;a href=&quot;https://mouse.org/mouse-design-league&quot;&gt;Design League&lt;/a&gt; program to spread out and work on assistive technology projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BGiUJ8awRJp/&quot;&gt;1derphone&lt;/a&gt;, a motorized headphone for a DJ with limited mobility. We also quickly realized we had the chance to reach more students in more ways by hosting flexible open events that any NYC students could attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hosted our first open &lt;a href=&quot;https://mouse.org/makernight&quot;&gt;Maker Night&lt;/a&gt; in March 2015 and it quickly became a space where students showed up and could work on anything creative and innovative. Every month, we saw new projects emerge from crafting, coding, and anything in between:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eku7Cc10Y9NSFAm7MP7tYA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*hA1_vnNXOvLg0WCWt6PluA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*ieyZhs_PDEsjWpTP8sDWaw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Pictures from Maker Night at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mouse.org/&quot;&gt;Mouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often test ideas for new creative activities at Maker Nights and one new project I had been playing around with was &lt;a href=&quot;https://forest-noodle.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;a simple chatbot&lt;/a&gt; that students could remix. We love teaching any new tech skill through activities that are quick and easy to jump into and have created a few introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://zircon-porch.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;coding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://distinct-zoo.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;activities&lt;/a&gt; using remixable JavaScript arrays (Check out a few of &lt;a href=&quot;https://automatic-triangle.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;Mouse‚Äôs Web Making activities&lt;/a&gt; created through our partnership with Mozilla).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We usually have students start out by quickly &lt;a href=&quot;https://efficacious-hook.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;remixing the chatbot‚Äôs script&lt;/a&gt;: have the bot ask about your day, or give the chatbot a unique personality. Then they can move on to second level challenges: &lt;a href=&quot;https://smart-raincoat.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;remix the interface CSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://possible-boot.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;teach the bot to repeat a user‚Äôs name back to them&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://obtainable-mosquito.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;teach the bot to respond to yes or no questions&lt;/a&gt;. All the linked examples are real student work, created between pizza slices at a Mouse Maker Night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R7wDi-aaq56c6scszMkT9g.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4frB9lA0wqCuoQMb_lLdHQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*B2IS5kkuK6FaQjmIsPJ3CA.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;3 remixes of the chatbot&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried out the chatbot at our March Maker Night with a few students from &lt;a href=&quot;http://lespnyc.com/&quot;&gt;Lower East Side Prep&lt;/a&gt;. Many LESP students are recent immigrants and as their principal notes on their website, their ‚Äústudent body represents more than 50 countries including the United States.‚Äù I sat down with a few LESP students, showed them the basics of editing the script and they instantly started creating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who were shy to get started or were nervous that they had never coded before were able to get familiar by creating linear scripts that anticipated a user‚Äôs responses or building in simple logic. One student who had recently moved to the U.S. created a bot that &lt;a href=&quot;https://lucky-bassoon.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;empathized with people who miss faraway friends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something about the narrative and engaging interface of a bot made students want to iterate on their designs. Two students would write a bot script, then switch and play each other‚Äôs bots. They would start by focusing on writing a friendly personality, then dive into a challenge like the bot learning a user‚Äôs name or a place name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments like these are exactly what Mouse strives to create with technology focused youth development curriculum. We love seeing language arts students publish writing online and code their own websites, history students create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D1iIEb49lE&quot;&gt;Serious Game&lt;/a&gt; about the civil rights movement, or science students make DIY Batteries to learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nofdW8nARTg&quot;&gt;Green Tech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Which Wearable Arduino Should I Use For My Sewable Tech Project?</title>
    <link href="http://example.com/blog/which-wearable-arduino-should-i-use-for-my-sewable-tech-project/"/>
    <updated>2017-09-29T00:00:00-00:00</updated>
    <id>http://example.com/blog/which-wearable-arduino-should-i-use-for-my-sewable-tech-project/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This fall &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@mouse_org&quot;&gt;Mouse&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mouse.org/&quot;&gt;mouse.org&lt;/a&gt;) launched our brand new &lt;a href=&quot;https://mouse.org/mouse-courses&quot;&gt;Sewable Tech Course&lt;/a&gt;! The course introduces learners to circuitry and electronics without the abstraction of a breadboard. In the final two projects in the course we use a wearable Arduino to prototype a DIY activity tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gfNKPipgo0Yp_bZLJLg7MQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Sew-matic for DIY Wearable Goal Tracker from Mouse Create&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question we ran into when I was helping my colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/katermouse&quot;&gt;Kate&lt;/a&gt; prototype the course was, which wearable Arduino to use. Along the way we tested 7 Arduino compatible microcontrollers and settled on recommending a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12049&quot;&gt;LilyPad Arduino USB&lt;/a&gt;, but there are advantages to each of the Arduinos we tested and different kinds projects would benefit from including each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*nxNOfE_aAIHrgXcgX8GSLQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Our collection of wearable arduinos&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12049&quot;&gt;Sparkfun LilyPad Arduino USB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=LilyPad+Arduino+USB+ATmega32U4&quot;&gt;Generic LilyPad Arduino USB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/659&quot;&gt;Adafruit FLORA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=LilyTiny&quot;&gt;Generic LilyTiny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/2470&quot;&gt;Arduino GEMMA&lt;/a&gt; (Discontinued)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/1222&quot;&gt;Adafruit GEMMA v2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/3501&quot;&gt;Adafruit GEMMA M0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the boards work with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software&quot;&gt;Arduino IDE&lt;/a&gt; (most with some extra steps), are roughly circular, and most run on 3.3 Volts, but there are slight differences that make certain boards better for some types of projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*FWirsLamzgR-H2Wbht2ZYg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[1] From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12049&quot;&gt;Sparkfun: $25&lt;/a&gt;, [2] &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=LilyPad+Arduino+USB+ATmega32U4&quot;&gt;Generic: $6 to $20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 Digital Pins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Analog Pins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard LED (D13)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On/Charge Switch and Reset Button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JST battery connector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2&amp;quot;/5 cm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial&quot;&gt;Supports Serial Communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LilyPad Arduinos are the only boards on this list that work with the Arduino IDE without any extra steps, this is the main reason why we recommend this board on Mouse Create. If this board will be your first experience with Arduino or you will need a few analog pins the LilyPad would be a great choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SparkFun model costs a bit more but a portion of the sales go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://leahbuechley.com/&quot;&gt;Leah Buechley&lt;/a&gt; to support open source e-textiles and e-textiles education development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful when buying to get the LilyPad Arduino USB if you need a USB connection. The original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13342&quot;&gt;LilyPad Arduino 328 Main Board&lt;/a&gt; (not pictured), requires an FTDI connection to upload code (but that one has more pins!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;[3] Adafruit FLORA&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*WOH8dSMPKiHUzYIAU4WerQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/659&quot;&gt;Adafruit $15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 Digital Pins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Analog Pins (D6, D9, D10, D12)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard LED (D7), Onboard RGB LED (D8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On/Off Switch and Reset Button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JST battery connector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.75&amp;quot;/4.5 cm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial&quot;&gt;Supports Serial Communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adafruit Flora is a great board and can handle any project. It‚Äôs smaller than the LilyPad but has 3 more pins, and the onboard RGB LED is very useful as a Hello, World. The only drawback to this board is &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.adafruit.com/add-boards-arduino-v164/overview&quot;&gt;adding the board in the Arduino IDE&lt;/a&gt; and installing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-ide-setup/windows-driver-installation&quot;&gt;Adafruit drivers on Windows&lt;/a&gt;, but both of these are one-time steps and don‚Äôt take more than a few minutes. We did have some issues uploading code via a USB 3.0 port, but this can be avoided by using a USB 2.0 hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;[4] Generic LilyTiny&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6Cx0oeFjZ0aGB6ek2vzCtQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=LilyTiny&quot;&gt;Generic $2 to $5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 Digital Pins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard LED (D1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1&amp;quot;/2.5 cm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found this board when researching and thought it might be useful for large groups with a limited budget to give every learner a board. This board has two easy to recognize advantages, it is both the smallest and the least expensive board on this list. The disadvantages are a little bit harder to spot so if you are thinking of using this board with a large group I would buy one to test with first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This board is the only one on this list that does not have alligator clip friendly pins. When testing we were still able to attach alligator clips, but it is easy to accidentally clip two pins and create a short circuit. This board also lacks both an on/off switch and a JST battery connector which means it has to be powered via USB or the 5V pin (this is the only board on this list that runs on 5V).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest disadvantage of this board is the upload process. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting&quot;&gt;Following these instructions&lt;/a&gt;, we had to add the board to the Arduino IDE, install Digistump drivers, and hit the plug in the board to USB at a specific point in the process. We also had issues with this board on USB 3.0 ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a lot of experience with Arduino or have a very small budget but a lot of patience this board might be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;[5] &amp;amp; [6] Arduino GEMMA and Adafruit GEMMA v2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*MyLI2jE1Oo2yA6sYbYQKCA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[6] From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/1222&quot;&gt;Adafruit $10&lt;/a&gt;, [5] From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/2470&quot;&gt;Adafruit (Discontinued)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Digital Pins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Analog Pin (D2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard LED (D1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On/Off Switch and Reset Button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JST battery connector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.25&amp;quot;/2.75 cm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these boards (along with the Gemma M0) are manufactured by Adafruit, and are visually and functionally very similar. The Arduino Gemma is teal and has the Adafruit logo on the back, the Adafruit Gemma v2 is black and has the Adafruit logo on the front. Both have an ATtiny85 chip that does not support serial communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Gemma boards are great small wearable Arduinos. The small number of pins and small size make this board very approachable for a beginner, and would make the perfect tool for a simple sewable tech project. We initially were going to recommend the Adafruit Gemma v2 on Mouse Create, but we had enough &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-gemma/about-the-bootloader&quot;&gt;issues with uploading via USB 3.0&lt;/a&gt; that instead of shipping a USB 2.0 hub along with the boards we decided to opt for the LilyPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already have a USB 2.0 hub or computers with USB 2.0 ports this board will work great. It does not have serial communication so it is best suited for simpler projects. Like the Adafruit Flora you will have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.adafruit.com/add-boards-arduino-v164/overview&quot;&gt;add the board to the Arduino IDE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-ide-setup/windows-driver-installation&quot;&gt;install the Adafruit drivers on Windows&lt;/a&gt; (for the Gemma V2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;[7] Adafruit GEMMA M0&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Qyf4eRy8XKT-_OwYjHu9xw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/3501&quot;&gt;Adafruit $10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Digital Pins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Analog Pins (D0, D1, D2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onbaord LED (D13), Onboard RGB LED (D?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On/Off Switch and Reset Button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JST battery connector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.25&amp;quot;/2.75 cm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial&quot;&gt;Serial Communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/01/09/welcome-to-the-adafruit-circuitpython-beta/&quot;&gt;Circuit Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adafruit GEMMA M0 was released just as we were finishing up our Sewable Tech course, a little too late to include in the kits we were putting together, but I still highly recommend this board. The Gemma M0 does everything the older Gemmas can and a lot more. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with USB 3.0 using this board, and the ATSAMD21E18 chip supports serial communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big step forward with the Gemma M0 and the reason Mouse might include this board in future kits is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/01/09/welcome-to-the-adafruit-circuitpython-beta/&quot;&gt;Circuit Python&lt;/a&gt;. A frequent question from schools interested in circuitry and electronics and sewable tech is ‚ÄúWill this Arduino work with my Chromebook?‚Äù Until now the answer has always been no (though the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software&quot;&gt;online Arduino IDE&lt;/a&gt; now works with Arduino Uno).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circuit Python allows you to use the Gemma M0 to bypass the Arduino IDE completely (but still works with the IDE if you prefer that). The board will show up as a drive when you plug it in to your computer (yes, even a Chromebook), and adding the following code to a file called &lt;code&gt;code.py&lt;/code&gt; will produce the familiar ‚ÄúBlink‚Äù Hello, World example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import digitalio
import board
import time
led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D13)
led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT
while True:
    led.value = not led.value
    time.sleep(0.5)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with other Adafruit Boards if you are using the Arduino IDE instead of Python you will have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.adafruit.com/add-boards-arduino-v164/overview&quot;&gt;add the board to the IDE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-ide-setup/windows-driver-installation&quot;&gt;install the Adafruit drivers on Windows&lt;/a&gt;. You may also have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gemma-m0/circuitpython&quot;&gt;reinstall Circuit Python&lt;/a&gt; if you go back and forth between the IDE and Circuit Python, but this is a simple drag and drop process. I‚Äôm also not sure how to control the RGB LED but I haven‚Äôt spent much time trying to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the boards we tested worked great once we figured out the tricks of each and any will work for most sewable tech projects. Once you decide on a board, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://mouse.org/work&quot;&gt;Mouse Create&lt;/a&gt; to find some fun projects!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I wanted to explore the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/async_function&quot;&gt;async/await&lt;/a&gt; functionality in Javascript so I started playing around with &lt;a href=&quot;https://async-await-machine.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;a project&lt;/a&gt; on Glitch (&lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/&quot;&gt;glitch.com&lt;/a&gt;) that would call one API after another, then generate new API call options from each cycle. I compiled a long list of potential APIs to use, but didn‚Äôt get past chaining together an &lt;a href=&quot;https://dog.ceo/dog-api/&quot;&gt;API that will respond with a picture of a specific breed of dog&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page&quot;&gt;Wikipedia API&lt;/a&gt; which could respond with the pages that came up in a search for the name of the breed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;A Glitch embed of my Dog ‚Üí Wikipedia API prototype: click on the name of a dog and you will get a picture of that dog, and a list of pages linked from that dog‚Äôs Wikipedia page.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started exploring what other APIs I could connect and realized that most of them seemed to enforce a relatively strict internal type system. Even from the many connections Wikipedia could provide it was hard to think of a potential next link that would always match up with the mishmash Wikipedia returned. While it might be easy to match up the Google Maps API to a weather API, connecting more abstract concepts was much more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ‚ÄòRecord Player‚Äô app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While thinking through this an idea jumped out at me. I could connect the Google Vision API to Spotify to find albums based on pictures of a record cover. The idea seemed so obvious that I figured someone else had already done it (with more thorough research later I found a few similar projects but none that were fully implemented).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that this spark of an idea was already a lot more interesting than my infinite API art project, but it still had the Rube Goldberg-esque quality I was going for. Even so, I still might have abandoned it without a tool like Glitch, which to me says, ‚Äúyour wacky idea is worth making (and it won‚Äôt take very long).‚Äù Using the skeleton of my previous project, I was able to put together (in about an hour) an app that bounced an image off of the Google Vision API then brought up search results from Spotify. I sent it to a friend who works at Spotify, and when she confirmed that it didn‚Äôt already exist I decided to spend a few hours putting together a more polished version (the hardest part turned out to be drag and drop file upload).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Glitch‚Äôs embed feature you can take a look at the app (and the code!) below:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;A Glitch embed of the Record Player app&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‚Äòfinal‚Äô version of the project, ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;http://record-player.glitch.me/&quot;&gt;Record Player&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù was surprisingly simple. When given a reasonably well lit image of an even somewhat popular album the Google Vision API is able to identify the name of the album (occasionally just the artist). There were a few words I hard coded to ignore (things like ‚Äúvinyl‚Äù, ‚Äúcd‚Äù, or ‚Äúimport‚Äù), but other than that I was able to send Google Vision‚Äôs ‚Äúbest guess‚Äù to Spotify, and play the first result. I designed a goofy front end (with every music related emoji) and shared it on Twitter thinking that a few people would try it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;A Glitch embed with my surprisingly short list of censored words&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anildash/&quot;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt; unexpectedly shared, and quickly it it started showing up &lt;a href=&quot;https://pitchfork.com/news/new-app-is-basically-shazam-for-album-covers/&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/05/new-app-automatically-recognizes-album-covers.html&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nme.com/news/music/app-album-cover-shazam-2306795&quot;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/04/record-player-app-image-based-spotify-search/&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.altpress.com/news/app_matches_album_covers_spotify/&quot;&gt;strange&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidauthority.com/record-player-spotify-google-861977/&quot;&gt;corners&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.it/musica/news-musica/ora-esiste-uno-shazam-per-le-copertine-degli-album/410773/&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/stream-a-vinyl-album-by-snapping-a-pic-of-its-cover-art-1825800020&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/05/02/app-album-covers&quot;&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;. I was flattered by the coverage, but a few people were pointing out, ‚Äúwhy would you take a picture instead of just typing in the name of the album?‚Äù First of all, it‚Äôs fun, which should be reason enough. But beyond that, there‚Äôs really no reason to right now, there are too many barriers and restrictions in place in the tools we use every day like Spotify and Google, that making a mashup like this will usually require an engineer instead of just an imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Record Player working on a Raspberry Pi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning I wanted to create a physical version of Record Player (inspired by the amazing things they seem to be doing at &lt;a href=&quot;https://dynamicland.org/&quot;&gt;Dynamicland&lt;/a&gt; without ‚Äútraditional‚Äù input and output devices). It would be a machine that could detect when you put a record cover in front of it, and automatically start playing the first song. No screens, no searching, no curated playlist to distract from the physical thing in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second time I was pleasantly surprised that by finding the right tools, a proof of concept was much easier than I expected. Using a Raspberry Pi with a camera module attached made a simple way to capture images. This left only the challenge of identifying when to start playing music. At first I thought that this might be easy to do by taking advantage of Google‚Äôs advanced image processing again, but I realized that the cost of the Google Vision API queries (you only get a certain amount free per month) would be prohibitive if I wanted the device to respond automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to see if a simple algorithm running on the Raspberry Pi could identify when something new was placed in front of the camera, which seemed to work well enough. Connecting this to a slightly modified version of the Node.js server that runs the original Record Player Glitch app created exactly the machine I had imagined. The video below shows my ‚ÄúRecord Player‚Äù automatically starting playback when it sees a record cover. This prototype has screens, but they‚Äôre only used to start the app and troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A video of the Record Player machine running on a Raspberry Pi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anil‚Äôs suggestion for using ‚ÄúRecord Player‚Äù when he shared the Glitch app, was to see what song came up when you take a selfie, or ‚ÄúShazam for your face‚Äù as he put it. Of course this was hilarious, and this is the kind of play and dynamic interactions that can happen when we start to break down the strict parameters and physical barriers that currently constrain our interactions with technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browsing Spotify is infinitely less interesting than browsing a friend‚Äôs record collection, but the convenience of any song ever recorded will usually win over the joy of discovering something unexpected. If we want this kind of ‚Äòmagic‚Äô to bring technology like Google Vision out of prepackaged apps in our phones and laptops we need to allow for new ways of communicating with computers, and each other, that allow for experimentation, weirdness and imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we start to join the interesting parts of the real world (for example: everything created before 1997) with the conveniences that smartphones have brought we can start to imagine dynamic digital experiences like the analog ones we have thought up for hundreds of years. Vinyl records themselves were designed as a static medium, but creative musicians saw a way to interact and started sampling and scratching them to create hip-hop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea for ‚ÄúRecord Player‚Äù only seemed obvious to me after a few hours of sifting through documentation for dozens of APIs. As users we can‚Äôt see the ‚Äúshape‚Äù of the internet, but these shapes determine what we can and can‚Äôt do, what we can and can‚Äôt imagine is possible. Surely every search on a weather or maps app is a city or address, almost all searches on Google Images are for nouns, and every search on Spotify or Genius is for an artist or song. But try connecting these services and APIs along unusual angles and you will start running into walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw a song at Google Maps to see where it was recorded? Pass a Yelp page to the New York Times API to find any news about the neighborhood? These queries might be possible, but they almost always require diving into the nitty gritty of several APIs, and massaging the data to make the connection. In today‚Äôs world ideas like ‚ÄúRecord Player‚Äù have to be a million dollar business to be worth doing. Many articles written about the Record Player app implied that Spotify had made it. The way that we experience modern technology tells us that only huge corporations are able to create new ways of experiencing the world.&lt;/p&gt;
